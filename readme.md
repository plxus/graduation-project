# graduation-project

*The graduation project of plusxu in NKU*

We designed and implemented the **Knowledge Repository Management System**. This is a knowledge sharing community for college students, and provides administrators and content operators of the system with corresponding management panels.

The function implementation of the website is based on the UGC pattern. Users can easily share the knowledge repository created by themselves to the platform. They can also browse the knowledge repository published by other users in various fields on the website. The website also achieved systematic and efficient organization of information resources, especially knowledge.
